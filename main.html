	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a way to measure how much time a program or an algorithm takes to run as the size of the input grows. It helps us understand how efficient our code is.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of memory a program uses while running. If a program stores n items (like in an array), it uses O(n) space, meaning the memory grows linearly with the input size.</p>
